This is a local URL management system

It seems that we need a system to manage and quickly access various web services in the LAN, and we also need a cabinet for integrating various web links.

Why not make a unified system to help us? 

This system will mainly achieve the following functions: 

1. Automatically scan and integrate various web services in the LAN on the same page.

2. Receive browser favorites from LAN devices and store them on the same page.

3. Provide a unified interface and a simple and intuitive UI interface to manage the above functions.
